NOTES
=====

The challenge states
> Don't use any frameworks like React, Angular or similar.

Noting that React is not a framework but just a rendering library, I will also assume that
[virtual dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) are
not to be used and that the point of the exercise is to see how I struggle with JQuery Hell.

This also means that I will not waste time trying to write tests for the front end.
